# Ichthyornis

Source code for the music by Ichthyornis. To run any songs, use [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and first edit and run config.rb. You can find a recorded version of a lot of the music [here](https://junber.bandcamp.com/).

Running some of these pieces yourself requires a MIDI device. I used an Akai LPD8.
